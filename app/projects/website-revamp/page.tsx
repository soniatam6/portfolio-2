                                <p>Airwallex is a fintech unicorn offering a variety of financial solutions for SMEs and enterprises, such as global money transfers, payment acceptance, and cards and expense management.</p>
                                <p>In November of 2022, Airwallex made the strategic decision to focus on enterprise customers and enter the embedded finance market. This meant that the company had to redefine how to tell the story about its products to potential customers, and rewrite its external facing product narratives. </p>
                                <p>As the main designer on this project, I was responsible for redesigning 17 product landing pages, where I worked closely with product managers, developers, product marketing, commercial and sales teams, and C-suite stakeholders. Through continuous iterations of my designs, I drove the efforts to define, visualize, and consolidate the messaging and narratives for all 17 of Airwallexâ€™s products.</p>

                    <p>Before designing, I believe that a designer must first understand what the JTBD are of the product they are designing. To understand the JTBD of a website, we must first look at who the users and stakeholders are of a website. </p>

                        <li><p><strong>Users: </strong>for a website, these are the viewers such as potential users or investors. From the users perspective, the website serves to give a brief overview of who the company is, what the company does, and what value can the company potentially bring to them. </p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Stakeholders: </strong>the internal teams who use the website to do their job, such as marketing, strategy, and product team. From the stakeholders&apos; perspective, the website serves as an instrument for them to craft a brand image, explain what their products are, and ultimately funnels potential users in to sign up. </p></li>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>From this, we can understand that the main JTBD of a website is to serve as a company&apos;s <strong>product story</strong>. It&apos;s the company&apos;s narrative and story to demonstrate who it is, what products it offers, and what value propositions it brings to stakeholders. In other words, when these users view the website, they need to be convinced to click the &apos;sign up&apos; or &apos;contact us&apos; button. At the same time, the website serves as a public brand and image for the company, and is the primary way for internal teams to convey to the world about who they are, what values they stand for, and what value they can bring to users.</p>

                                        <p>For Expense Management, one of the challenges I faced was how to balance the perspective of different roles. The Expense Management product served two main types of users: </p>
                                        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 lg:pl-4 space-y-2 ">

                                            <li><p><strong>Administrators:</strong> Administrators want an easy way to manage and approve expenses. Employees want an easy way to see and review their expenses. </p></li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>The original structural proposal was to have one section talk about the â€˜all in one cards and expenses experienceâ€™ and discuss general value propositions. However, I noticed the value propositions were very different for both types of users, and mixing them up felt quite confusing as a viewer. One of my ideas was to have separate sections for different user types, but it also compromised the â€˜all in oneâ€™ experience value proposition. </p>
                                        <p>After presenting both proposals and their tradeoffs to stakeholders, we reached alignment to have an overhead section discussing the â€˜all in one experienceâ€™, and then have subsections specifically for each user type.</p>

                                <li><p>What are the key value propositions that is written on the side, and what are some screens that would demonstrate those points?</p></li>

                            <p>From the visual design and branding perspective, our stakeholders thought the old website wasnâ€™t confident enough in its image and impression. We sought to fix this by redefining the widescreen responsiveness. First, we changed all the content widths to a wider standard, then modified some content models to adapt to a wider width. Then we added a new breakpoint for wide screens so that when viewing the website on a large screen, the content wonâ€™t feel small.</p>
                            <p>Working on responsiveness was notably more challenging than I thought, as the logic can sometimes be very confusing and hard to express on Figma. We ended up spending a lot of time and effort to develop a demo version of the site with wide screen responsiveness changes just to demonstrate to stakeholders what the effects were like. </p>
