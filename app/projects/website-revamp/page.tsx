As the main designer, I was responsible for redesigning 17 product landing pages, where I worked closely with product managers, developers, the marketing team, and C-suite stakeholders. </p>

In other words, when these users view the website, they need to be convinced to click the &apos;sign up&apos; or &apos;contact us&apos; button. At the same time, the website serves as a public brand and image for the company, and is the primary way for internal teams to convey to the world about who they are, what values they stand for, and what value they can bring to users.</p>

                                        <p>For Expense Management, one of the challenges I faced was how to balance the perspective of different roles. The Expense Management product served two main types of users: </p>

                                        </ol>
                                        <p>The original structural proposal was to have one section talk about the â€˜all in one cards and expenses experienceâ€™ and discuss general value propositions. However, I noticed the value propositions were very different for both types of users, and mixing them up felt quite confusing as a viewer. One of my ideas was to have separate sections for different user types, but it also compromised the â€˜all in oneâ€™ experience value proposition. </p>
                                        <p>After presenting both proposals and their tradeoffs to stakeholders, we reached alignment to have an overhead section discussing the â€˜all in one experienceâ€™, and then have subsections specifically for each user type.</p>

                            <p>From the visual design and branding perspective, our stakeholders thought the old website wasnâ€™t confident enough in its image and impression. We sought to fix this by redefining the widescreen responsiveness. First, we changed all the content widths to a wider standard, then modified some content models to adapt to a wider width. Then we added a new breakpoint for wide screens so that when viewing the website on a large screen, the content wonâ€™t feel small.</p>
                            <p>Working on responsiveness was notably more challenging than I thought, as the logic can sometimes be very confusing and hard to express on Figma. We ended up spending a lot of time and effort to develop a demo version of the site with wide screen responsiveness changes just to demonstrate to stakeholders what the effects were like. </p>
